Summary of abusive\_model.py
============================

The `abusive_model.py` file sets up the environment and defines the necessary components for training a machine learning model to classify abusive language in text data. The code imports various libraries, defines several variables and objects used for training a machine learning model, sets up GPU memory growth, loads training and validation data using BigQueryFeatureLoader, and prepares the data for input into a neural network model.

The code defines a prototype of the model using a set of features, including both categorical and continuous features. It then sets up various parameters for the model training process, such as the batch size, learning rate, optimizer type, and number of epochs. The labeled data is parsed and a MirroredStrategy object is created for distributing the training process across multiple GPUs.

The code sets up the neural network model architecture and compiles the model with a custom loss function and metrics. Additionally, it sets up Weights & Biases (W&B) for experiment tracking and logging.

The `abusive_model.py` file takes no parameters and returns no output. Its purpose is to define the necessary components for training a machine learning model to classify abusive language in text data.
