Summary
-------

The `default_settings_tox.py` file initializes global variables used in a machine learning model training process. It also imports the `google.cloud` package and creates a `bigquery.Client` object if default credentials are available. The table below summarizes the variables and their descriptions:



| Variable Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| TEAM\_PROJECT | Name of the Google Cloud project where the training data and model will be stored |
| CLIENT | A `bigquery.Client` object used to access data stored in BigQuery |
| TRAINING\_DATA\_LOCATION | Location of the training data |
| GCS\_ADDRESS | Address of the Google Cloud Storage bucket where the model will be saved |
| LOCAL\_DIR | The current working directory |
| REMOTE\_LOGDIR | The directory in the GCS bucket where training logs will be stored |
| MODEL\_DIR | The directory in the GCS bucket where the trained model will be saved |
| EXISTING\_TASK\_VERSIONS | Set of existing task versions |
| RANDOM\_SEED | Random seed used for reproducibility |
| TRAIN\_EPOCHS | Number of training epochs |
| MINI\_BATCH\_SIZE | Number of samples per mini-batch |
| TARGET\_POS\_PER\_EPOCH | Number of positive samples to target per epoch |
| PERC\_TRAINING\_TOX | Percentage of training data that is toxic |
| MAX\_SEQ\_LENGTH | Maximum sequence length of the input data |
| WARM\_UP\_PERC | Percentage of training steps used for warm-up |
| OUTER\_CV | Number of outer cross-validation folds |
| INNER\_CV | Number of inner cross-validation folds |
| NUM\_PREFETCH | Number of samples to prefetch |
| NUM\_WORKERS | Number of parallel workers to use for data loading and preprocessing |

The code does not take any parameters or return anything.
